Summary:
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing two players to take turns and play on a 3Ã—3 grid with win detection and draw handling.
Description:
This web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple yet interactive implementation of the traditional two-player game. The project uses:

HTML to structure the game grid

CSS for styling and responsiveness

JavaScript to handle game logic, turn management, and win/draw conditions

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

3Ã—3 grid clickable interface

Alternating turns between Player X and Player O

Win detection in rows, columns, and diagonals

Draw detection if all boxes are filled without a winner

"Restart Game" button to reset the board

This project is great for learning how to:

Work with the DOM

Manage application state (e.g., whose turn it is)

Implement game logic and UI updates

Practice clean, modular JavaScript coding

You can easily enhance it later by adding:

Single-player mode vs. computer

Score tracking

Animations or sound effects
